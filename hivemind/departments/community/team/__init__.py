Team Summary & Workflow
Team Size: A lean community team of 4–5 key roles should be sufficient for a growing crypto project.
Collaboration: These roles will work closely to ensure a consistent and engaging community presence. The Community Manager AI oversees overall strategy and performance, while moderators handle daily interactions, the Events Coordinator drives engagement through activities, the Partnerships Strategist expands the network, and the Content Curator ensures timely and appealing communications.
Focus Areas:
Daily Interaction & Moderation: Keeping channels active, friendly, and informative.
Event-Driven Engagement: Running contests, AMAs, and live sessions to keep the community involved.
Strategic Growth: Building partnerships with external communities and influencers to broaden reach.
Content & Updates: Sharing project progress, exclusive insights, and maintaining brand voice across all platforms.
Reporting Structure:
The Community Manager AI collects daily reports from moderators, the Events Coordinator, the Partnerships Strategist, and the Content Curator, then synthesizes this data into a comprehensive update for the CEO or Marketing Lead.
Each role’s performance (e.g., engagement metrics, event participation rates, partnership leads) is tracked and adjusted as needed to meet community growth objectives.
By structuring your community team with these clearly defined roles and responsibilities, you ensure that DegenHive’s community remains vibrant, informed, and continuously growing—key for sustaining interest in your crypto DEX, liquid staking protocol, and the unique ecosystem powered by DragonBee NFTs.

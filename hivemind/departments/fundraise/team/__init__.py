"""
For a lean fundraising team tailored to a crypto DEX, liquid staking protocol, and NFT ecosystem like DegenHive, a four-person team covering these roles should be sufficient initially. This team can scale as fundraising needs expand or as the project grows. The ideal candidate profiles emphasize:

Crypto/DeFi Expertise: Proven track record or deep understanding of blockchain, decentralized finance, and NFT ecosystems.
Strategic Communication: Ability to articulate complex, technical, and financial information in a clear, compelling manner.
Relationship Management: Experience building and maintaining relationships with investors and key stakeholders.
Analytical Acumen: Strong financial modeling and market analysis skills to back up fundraising efforts with data.
Each role should be a perfect blend of industry experience and startup agilityâ€”ensuring that DegenHive can secure the capital needed to grow its innovative ecosystem while building trust with a diverse investor base.

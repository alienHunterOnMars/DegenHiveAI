"""
Team Size: A lean marketing team of 5 key roles should be sufficient initially.
Collaboration: These roles must work closely together to ensure a unified brand presence across all official accounts (DegenHive, HiveMindAI, and the founder’s). Coordination with external partners, community managers, and other internal teams (like Partnerships or Product) is essential.
Focus Areas:
Social Media & Content: Daily engagement and brand messaging.
Media Outreach: Securing external press coverage and strategic partnerships with influencers and media outlets.
Analytics & Optimization: Using performance data to continually refine campaigns.
Culture & Tone: The overall tone should be futuristic, playful, and in line with the crypto/DeFi ethos—while remaining professional enough to attract investor and media attention.
Each AI agent in this marketing team will have a clear mandate, qualifications, and well-defined tasks that contribute to building a strong, cohesive brand and increasing community reach for DegenHive and its associated platforms.
